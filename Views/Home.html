            Kino was a Soviet rock band formed in Leningrad in 1982, considered to be one of, if not the greatest rock band in the history of Russian music.
            The band was co-founded and headed by Viktor Tsoi, who wrote the music and lyrics for almost all of the band's songs.
            Over the course of eight years, Kino had released over 90 songs spanning over seven studio albums,
            as well as releasing a few compilations and live albums. The band's music was also widely circulated in the form of bootleg recordings.
            Viktor Tsoi died in a car accident in 1990. Shortly after his passing, the band broke up after releasing their final album,
            consisting of songs that Tsoi and the group were working on in the months before his death.
